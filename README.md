# Rocket-Instrumentation_System
A prototype payload electronic sensor circuit for a rocket instrumentation system, based on an Arduino and a selection of sensors. 
The design sprint involved designing and prototyping an electronic sensor circuit for a rocket instrumentation system, based on an Arduino and a selection of sensors. The circuit's function was to collect data related to the rocket's mission parameters and compared it with data from calculations and tests. Using a top-down approach, the objectives of the circuit were explored and then broken down into defining specific objectives, constraints, and design specifications to achieve that goal. We then tested and iterated our initial designs to arrive at a final design that collects pressure, temperature, altitude, and acceleration data that can be used to cover all the data requirements. We then analysed the performance of our design with several tests such as pendulum motion, elevator lift, pressure box, and a heat gun, replacing the cancelled rocket launch to find it successful for these tests. Feather M0 Adalogger microcontroller with built-in SD card reader, BMP280 temperature and pressure sensor, ADXL345 accelerometer and buzzer were the used components.
